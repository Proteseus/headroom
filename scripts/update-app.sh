# The app runs this too, from inside its own bundle, passing the version and
# URL it read from the update feed (docs/updater.md). That is why --url exists:
# the day the zip moves off GitHub Releases, the feed says so and nothing here
# or in the app needs to know where it went.
#
# Works from a clone or on its own — no gh, no auth, public repo. System tools
# only: curl, unzip, plutil, codesign, spctl, launchctl.
#
# Why this is not just "unzip over the top": the host does not run from the
# clone, it runs from *inside the bundle*
# (Contents/Resources/host/headroom_server.py) under a KeepAlive LaunchAgent.
# Replacing the app under a live agent leaves launchd holding the old code and
# restarting it within seconds, so the swap has to bracket itself with
# bootout/bootstrap. The board's usage data comes through that process, so a
# failed restore looks exactly like broken hardware.
