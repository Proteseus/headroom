# Headroom for the menu bar

Native macOS 14+ companion. The Release `.app` **bundles the Python host** —
first launch’s Welcome sheet starts it automatically and installs a login item.

- Status item: thin remaining-quota meters for **enabled** providers + attention pip
- Usage: quota rings, daily burn, attention + spend
- Notification Center widget: the same extension the iPhone runs, rings on the
  small size and the combined burndown on the medium one
- Welcome / setup sheet when the host is down or on first open, asking about
  **AI coding tools** and **Integrations** separately
- Settings: endpoint, the two source lists, host/mobile tokens, integration keys

Product install overview: [../README.md](../README.md). First-run sources and
tokens: [../docs/setup.md](../docs/setup.md).

## Easiest path

Download `Headroom-macOS.zip` from GitHub Releases, open the app, confirm
providers on Welcome. Notarized builds open without Gatekeeper workarounds —
see [docs/releasing.md](../docs/releasing.md).

**Updating.** [`scripts/update-app.sh`](../scripts/update-app.sh) replaces an
installed `Headroom.app` with the current Release. It refuses anything that is
not notarized and signed by the project's team, and it brackets the swap with
`launchctl bootout` / `bootstrap` — the host runs from inside the bundle under
a KeepAlive agent, so replacing the app under a live agent leaves launchd
holding the old code.

```bash
./scripts/update-app.sh --check
./scripts/update-app.sh
```

## Build from source

```sh
./scripts/build-app.sh          # embeds host → dist/Headroom.app
open dist/Headroom.app
```

Version is `host/VERSION` + git commit count (`./scripts/version-env.sh`).

**The widget needs a team on the signature.** App and extension share their
cache through an app group, and on macOS a group id carries the team id — so an
ad-hoc build (`build-app.sh` without `--notarize`) is denied the container and
the widget draws its placeholder forever. Run from Xcode with your own team
(automatic signing) or build `--release --notarize` for real numbers in
Notification Center.

### Debug build (host from clone)

```bash
./scripts/install-host.sh
./scripts/gen-project.sh          # embeds host + writes Headroom.xcodeproj
cd macos
xcodebuild -project Headroom.xcodeproj -scheme Headroom \
  -configuration Debug -derivedDataPath .build build
open .build/Build/Products/Debug/Headroom.app
```

**Foreground try** (no login item): `./scripts/install-host.sh --foreground`  
**Uninstall LaunchAgent:** `./scripts/uninstall-host.sh` (`--purge` wipes `~/.headroom`)

## Opening the project in Xcode

A fresh clone contains no `.xcodeproj`: `macos/project.yml` is the source of
truth and XcodeGen writes the project from it, so `macos/Headroom.xcodeproj`
is gitignored. On a new Mac:

```bash
brew install xcodegen
./scripts/gen-project.sh
open macos/Headroom.xcodeproj
```

Go through the script rather than calling `xcodegen generate` yourself.
`project.yml` lists `macos/host` as a source directory, and that folder is a
gitignored copy of the host made by `sync-embedded-host.sh` — on a fresh clone
bare xcodegen stops at a missing source directory, which does not point at the
real cause. The script syncs first.

Anything touching the watch app needs the beta toolchain, and that includes the
iPhone app, which embeds it. Stable Xcode reports a watchOS SDK and still
resolves every watch destination to *"watchOS 26.5 is not installed"*:

```bash
open -a /Applications/Xcode-beta.app macos/Headroom.xcodeproj
```

Regenerate after any pull that adds files. A new file under `Shared/` will not
be in last week’s project, and the failure reads as a missing type rather than
a stale project. **Quit Xcode before regenerating** — replacing the project
underneath a running Xcode produces *"The project “Headroom” is not a valid
property list"* on a file that is perfectly valid.

## Signing as yourself

Only needed when Xcode actually signs — running on your own iPhone or Watch,
notarizing, TestFlight. Unsigned builds (`build-app.sh`, the test commands)
skip signing entirely.

Create `macos/Local.xcconfig` — gitignored, survives pulls and regeneration:

```xcconfig
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = ABCDE12345

// Optional — only iOS / watchOS device builds need it, because Apple will
// not register the maintainer's com.centaur-labs.* App IDs to your team:
// HEADROOM_BUNDLE_PREFIX = com.example.you
```

Put overrides there and nowhere else — `macos/Version.xcconfig` is regenerated
on every build. Device-build details: [docs/ios-companion.md](../docs/ios-companion.md).
