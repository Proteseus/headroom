# Headroom

**Your AI coding quotas and ship status — in the menu bar, on your phone, and
optionally on the desk.**

When you're deep in Claude, Codex, or Cursor, you shouldn't have to dig through
billing pages, `gh`, and Vercel to answer: *Am I about to hit a limit? Did CI
go red? Is prod healthy?*

Headroom is a **local-first** macOS menu bar app (+ optional iPhone / Watch).
One Python host on your Mac reads the auth and CLIs you already have and serves
a single JSON feed. No Headroom cloud account — tokens stay on the machine.

| Surface | What you see |
|---|---|
| **Menu bar** | Thin remaining-quota tanks for the first three enabled providers + amber/red attention pip |
| **Popover** | Overview rings, daily burn, spend, Activity / Services |
| **Notification Center** | Same widget as the iPhone: rings small, combined burndown medium |
| **iPhone / iPad** | Quotas, burndown, activity, services, controls, notifications, widgets |
| **Apple Watch** | Two complications: rings, or the week's burndown |
| **ESP32 desk board** *(optional)* | Same three rings + burndown on a Waveshare AMOLED — [docs/esp32.md](docs/esp32.md) |

## Why it exists

- **Quota anxiety** — session / weekly windows, pace, and spend on one ring
  (and a menu-bar tick per provider in focus).
- **Ship status ambient** — failed Actions, Vercel, Supabase, local servers as
  an attention pip, not another tab.
- **Local-first** — credentials and CLIs you already have; optional board can
  fall back to USB when hotel Wi‑Fi blocks mDNS.

## Requirements

| Need | Notes |
|---|---|
| macOS 14+ | Menu bar app |
| Python 3.9+ | Bundled host is **stdlib only** (system `/usr/bin/python3`) |
| At least one AI coding tool | Already signed in locally |
| Optional: iPhone / iPad (iOS 17+) | Same LAN or Tailscale as the Mac |
| Optional: PlatformIO | Only to flash the desk board |

No Headroom cloud account.

## Quick start

### 1. Mac app (Release)

1. Download **Headroom-macOS.zip** from
   [Releases](https://github.com/michellzappa/headroom/releases).
2. Open `Headroom.app` → menu bar meters → **Welcome**.
3. On a Release build the host starts automatically and stays up at login.
4. Confirm detected providers → **Continue**.

Build from source, Xcode, and signing: [macos/README.md](macos/README.md).

### 2. iPhone (optional)

[TestFlight](docs/install-links.md) when published, or build from source —
[docs/ios-companion.md](docs/ios-companion.md). Use the **mobile token** from
Mac Settings → iPhone pairing (not the host token).

### 3. Desk board (optional)

Waveshare **ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.8** only. Flash, config, brightness:
[docs/esp32.md](docs/esp32.md).

## After install

| Topic | Doc |
|---|---|
| Sources, extra accounts, colours, focus order, tokens | [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md) |
| `~/.headroom` keys + HTTP endpoints | [docs/host.md](docs/host.md) |
| Something’s broken | [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md) |

```bash
curl -s localhost:8737/health | python3 -m json.tool
```

Build and test commands: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). The host is
stdlib-only Python; every surface has to keep agreeing about `/usage`.
