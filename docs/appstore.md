# App Store Connect — Headroom

Canonical listing copy for the **iOS** companion
(`com.centaur-labs.headroom`, ASC id `6795549853`).
Push with Tiny’s metadata script or paste into ASC / `asc metadata`.

macOS ships via GitHub Releases (Developer ID), not the Mac App Store — yet.

## App Information

- **App Name**: Headroom (Max your Quotas)
- **Subtitle** (30 chars max): Local-first coding quotas

> The suffix is load-bearing: **"Headroom" alone is taken on the App Store**,
> and listing names have to be unique. It is not keyword stuffing and it is not
> up for tidying — a shorter name is not available. `CFBundleDisplayName` is
> plain `Headroom` on both platforms, so the home screen and the menu bar are
> unaffected by whatever the listing has to be called.
>
> "Max" reads two ways — the Claude Max plan, and *maximise your usage* — and
> the first is the one the audience searching for this lands on. Recorded here
> so the ambiguity stops being rediscovered as a bug.

## Listing copy

Not pinned to a version. This file was headed "Version 1.0.3" and sat there
through 1.2.7, because the description and keywords do not change per release
and nobody was going to renumber a heading that meant nothing. **What's New is
the only per-release field, and its source is `CHANGELOG.md`** — copy the
section for the version being submitted rather than maintaining a second one
here that drifts.

### Description (4000 chars max)

Headroom keeps your AI coding quotas and ship status in one glance — on your
iPhone, beside the Mac menu bar, and (optionally) on a desk display.

When you’re deep in Claude, Codex, or Cursor, you shouldn’t have to dig through
billing pages, `gh`, and dashboards to answer: Am I about to hit a limit? Did
CI go red? Is prod healthy?

Headroom’s companion app on iPhone and iPad reads a local feed from a small
host on your Mac. No Headroom cloud account. Provider credentials stay in the
Mac Keychain. The phone only gets what you grant: read, refresh, source
toggles, and stopping local servers.

Features:
- Coding quota rings for Claude, Codex, and Cursor — remaining %, pace, resets
- Burndown and daily burn across providers
- Attention queue with optional notifications — including answering agent
  requests when the Mac grants it
- Activity: deploys, commits, Actions, plus Supabase / Plausible / PostHog and
  local servers on the same tab
- Home Screen widgets backed by an on-device cache
- Bonjour discovery of nearby Macs (Tailscale / LAN fallback)
- Face ID before stopping a development server on your Mac
- Pull-to-refresh that can force the Mac host to re-poll sources

Pair once: keep Headroom running on the Mac, allow Local Network on the phone,
pick your Mac under Nearby Macs, paste the mobile token from Mac Settings →
iPhone pairing.

Hardware is optional. The Waveshare ESP32 desk display and the macOS menu bar
app share the same local host — this iOS app is the pocket companion.

### Keywords (100 chars max, comma-separated)

### What's New

Paste the `CHANGELOG.md` section for the version being submitted into ASC.
Ready copy for **1.7.3** (trim if ASC’s field is tight):

```
Recent resets is a calendar heatmap under each burndown — day grid for
granted resets; Codex week merges codex-resets.com with local grants.

Activity and Attention rows share one layout on Mac and iPhone.

Vercel failed deploys no longer fall off Attention — ERROR/BLOCKED from the
last 24h stay visible even on a busy team.

Activity row limit (3–24) sits on every Activity source leaf.

README and setup match Usage · Attention · Activity (Providers, Agents,
Telemetry).
```

### Promotional Text (170 chars max, can be updated without review)

Know what's left before you hit the wall. Claude, Codex, and Cursor quotas on
your phone — local-first, no Headroom cloud account.

## Privacy Details

  Mac host over the local network / Tailscale
- **Tracking**: No
- **Data Linked to You**: None
- **Data Not Linked to You**: None
- **Third-party SDKs**: None (no analytics, ads, or crash reporters)
- **Local Network**: Used to discover and reach the Headroom host on your Mac
- **Face ID**: Optional, only before stopping a local server you choose
- **Credentials**: Provider tokens (Claude, GitHub, Supabase, …) stay on the Mac;
  the phone uses a separate mobile pairing token

## Screenshots (required)

Apple sizes (portrait):

| Device class | Size (px) |
|---|---|
| iPhone 6.7" | 1290 × 2796 |
| iPhone 6.5" | 1284 × 2778 |
| iPad 12.9" (if shipping iPad) | 2048 × 2732 |

Minimum: **3** iPhone shots. Aim for **5–6** that sell one idea each
(not a UI tour). Working captures live under `docs/screenshots/` — regenerate
framed App Store slides later.

Recommended set:

1. **Usage rings** — “Your quotas, one glance”
2. **Attention** — “What needs an answer”
3. **Activity** — “CI and deploys without another tab”
4. **Pairing / Nearby Macs** — “Local-first. Your Mac, your tokens.”
5. **Widget** — “On the Home Screen, too”

## Notes for Review

Headroom for iPhone is a companion to a local Mac host included with the
open-source Headroom project (https://github.com/michellzappa/headroom).

To review:

1. On a Mac, install Headroom from GitHub Releases (or build from source) and
   complete the Welcome sheet so the host is running on port 8737.
2. On the review device, allow Local Network access when prompted.
3. Open the app → Nearby Macs should list the review Mac (same Wi‑Fi). Tap it.
4. On the Mac: Settings → iPhone pairing → Copy mobile token → paste on the
   phone → Connect.

If Bonjour fails on the review network, enter:

```text
http://<mac-lan-ip>:8737/usage
```

and the mobile token from `~/.headroom/mobile-token`.

The app does not require an Apple ID login, Headroom account, or third-party
API keys on the phone. Quota data appears only after the Mac host can read
local Claude / Codex / Cursor sign-in state. Demo fixture mode is not required
for a basic pairing + empty/error UI review; for populated quotas, sign into at
least one coding tool on the Mac before pairing.

Export compliance: the app only uses standard HTTPS / local HTTP for the host
feed (`ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption` = false).
